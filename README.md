# Autonomous Line-Following Robot with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance


## Project Overview
A **smart mobile robot** that autonomously follows a black-line path while detecting and avoiding obstacles in real-time. Developed as part of the **Computer Controlled Systems** module at The British University in Egypt, this project integrates:
- **Sensor fusion** (IR + Ultrasonic)
- **Control theory** (PID tuning, state-space analysis)
- **Embedded systems** (Arduino programming)

**Key Achievements**:
- 87% accuracy in line-tracking under variable lighting
- Obstacle detection response time: **0.25s**
- MATLAB-optimized PID control (7.7x faster rise time)
## Features

- Line Following using a 3-way IR sensor module  
- Obstacle Detection using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor  
- Path Recovery after obstacle avoidance  
- Servo-based scanning from 0¬∞ to 180¬∞ for better pathfinding  
- Autonomous behavior blending both line tracking and obstacle navigation

 
## Hardware Used

- Arduino Uno  
- 3-way IR sensor module  
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor  
- DXW90 servo motor  
- L298N motor driver  
- 4 DC motors  
- Chassis with wheels and caster  
- Jumper wires, battery pack, breadboard

 
## PMDC Motor Mathematical Model and State-Space Representation

This project models a **Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) Motor** system based on its electrical and mechanical dynamics.

## System Parameters
- **Moment of inertia (J):** 0.01 kg¬∑m¬≤  
- **Viscous damping coefficient (B):** 0.1 N¬∑m¬∑s/rad  
- **Electromotive force constant (Ke = Kt):** 0.01 (Nm/A or V/(rad/s))  
- **Armature resistance (R):** 1 Œ©  
- **Electric inductance (L):** 0.5 H
  

## Mathematical Model
The modeling is based on the application of **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)** to the electrical circuit and Newton‚Äôs law for rotational dynamics:
